# Operating-Systems-Project

During operating systems module of my course, i was asked to carry out a project based on operating systems 
using c programming language. The project was completed by one of my colleagues and myself. The aim was to implement 
a server for a multi-player online game with a specific number of players. 
As soon as this number is reached a new game begins in parallel with the other games, either using fork() or threads.
For each game, the players communicate and exchange messages, using socket.
